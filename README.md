Virtual recreation of a classic board game
Select between two different boards (Europe and Britain), and then play against another player!
To avoid the need for an online connection, you enter a "seed" at the start which will deal with all the random elements of the game and ensure you experience the same "randomness". Both players open the Board and Player windows.
